## Organization
* Makefile: will be used to automate building the compiler, as soon as we understand what we are doing in this life
* the `include/` folder will be used to put every library header `.h` we may have to make when we go to that interesting part...
* the `src/` forlder will contain `include/*`'s respectives implementations
* root directory is going to contains respectives formal descriptions of the language.
